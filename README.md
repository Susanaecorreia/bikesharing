## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Purpose of this analysis is to perform a review of Citi Bike Data for New York City using Tableau.


## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

The dashboard shows filters for the user to explore, gender and usertype. Breaking down the trips by usertype and gender, shows that subscribers make up a large number of the trips, however customers tend to make longer trips. This makes sense because subscribers are every day commuters who probably commute to work only during the weekdays, whereas customers are most likely travelers who like to explore the city. However, it must be noted that within subscribers the gap between the number of trips made by each gender is large. Female subscribers make less trips than male subscribers. The time breakdown shows no difference between the usertype or genders. The weekends show a larger range from 11am to 7pm. However, within the weekdays too it appears 4pm to 7pm are the traffic hours. On the map, it is possible to see the location of all the stations and distinguish the popular started locations, therefore it may be possible to move bikes from less popular stations to more popular stations to efficiently utilize all the bikes.

If I were to explore this particualr data set further, I would consider a deeper dive into:

Gender & User Type differences with the majority data sets removed (MALE & SUBSCRIBER) to see if there is any further detail which can be obtained from minority user groups.

Consider application of time as a layer to the geographical mapping to visualize peak and trough usage over the course of the day and to check if there is any geographic relationship.
